# Health Care Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to My Health Care Analysis project! This data science project focuses on exploring and analyzing a healthcare dataset obtained from Kaggle, curated by 
PRASAD PATIL. The dataset contains valuable information related to healthcare, and our goal is to derive meaningful insights and build predictive models to enhance our understanding of the data.

## Project Structure

- **Notebooks:** This directory contains a Jupyter notebook used for data analysis, visualization, and model development. Each section of this notebook is designed to take you through specific aspects of the project, from data exploration to machine learning model implementation.

- **Data:** The dataset used in this project is stored in the same directory for easy acces (as healthcare_dataset.csv). You can find the original dataset as well archived and named as archive(1).zip.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/OwanDaisy/Data_Science_-_ML.git
   cd Data_Science_-_ML/main/Health_Care_Analysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the Notebook:**
   Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory. Start with the notebook named `wrangle_act.ipynb` to get an overview of the dataset.



## Dataset Information

The healthcare dataset used in this project is provided by yours truly(me) but was downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset includes various features related to health, and an abitrarily choosen target variable that involves prediction and classification tasks. Refer to Kaggle for more details on the dataset: [Health Care Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset).
