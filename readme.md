# Rock and Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on predicting whether underwater obstacles detected by SONAR technology are rocks or mines. The project utilizes a logistic regression model for accurate binary classification.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of fictional SONAR data. It contains various features extracted from SONAR signals, representing the characteristics of different objects found underwater. The goal is to train a model that can distinguish between rocks and mines based on these features.

## Project Structure

The project repository is structured as follows:
* The  `sonar.csv` file, which is the dataset used for training and testing the model.
* The  `Mine_Rock_model.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. This notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of the logistic regression model, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
* The `README.md` file (this file) serves as a guide to the repository, offering an overview of the project and its structure.

## Getting Started

To begin exploring and working with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
